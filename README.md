This is an Steps Converter app used HTML/CSS/JavaScript application coded from scratch. Application itself is a Steps converter .. say you walked today 31450 steps (info from your iphone or android app) but you don't know what does that mean in Miles ? or how much calories have you burned ? so you enter the number of steps in the input box and it outputs the result after a nice loading animation is being displayed (just used UX, nothing more - a simple setTimeOut method).
